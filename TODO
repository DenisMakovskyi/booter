1. Receive the boot event in BootReceiver and make a one-time work request ('one-time worker') to persist the event timestamp in the local DB via BootRepository(not implemented).

2. BootRepository stores the event history, calculates the delay between notifications, and schedules the next notification appearance using the data saved in ConfigPreferences.

3. BootRepository also defines the NotificationContent and sends all necessary data to the 'periodic worker', which is responsible for notification delivery.

4. The 'periodic worker' may be updated (cancelled and rescheduled) if the user dismisses the notification.

5. When the notification is dismissed by the user, the app catches this event in the NotificationReceiver and invokes the appropriate method in BootRepository, which increments ConfigPreferences::dismissedCount value. 
As a result, the next notification delay is recalculated, and the 'periodic worker' is updated.

6. Create a simple screen (activity + ViewModel) to display the boot event history and provide an ability to change the configuration.
